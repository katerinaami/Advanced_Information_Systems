# Advanced_Information_Systems

Team Project

Organizing the process of making an advanced informational system which goal is to support the operation
of the public service program "Help at home". We thought of creating a system (which contains a mobile app, a controller and a smartwatch)
that is going to replace the procedure of the people entitled of the program have to follow now (calling the public service for whatever they need). 
We thought about creating a device that with a simple touch of a button could create a request to the offices of the service provider.
Furthermore the controller will be connected with a smartwatch that gathers the vitals signs of the person wearing it and transmits the data for further analysis.
After that the data is processed by an AI system and form a profile for this individual. Last but not least the system also offers an application that
will help people, that are close to the individuals entitled of the service, monitor their loved ones.
